# SOL6502

This is the SOL 6502 Webbrower friendly 6502 computer simulator.  It is a companion to the "Under the Covers: The Secret Life of Software" textbook material.  This is a work in progress -- many bugs and features need tending too.

You can access it here:   https://jappavoo.github.io/SOL6502/

It simulates the complete operation of a 6502 based computer in a way that you see how things are working on the inside ;-)
